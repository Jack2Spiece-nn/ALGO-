python src/main.py --paper --test-mode
```

### **Step 3: Check the Results**
Look for these files in your project directory:
- `logs/` - Trading logs and system messages
- `results/` - Performance reports and trade history
- `models/` - Trained AI models

---

## üìä **Understanding the Results**

### **Trading Signals Explained**

**Signal Types:**
- **BUY**: AI predicts price will go up
- **SELL**: AI predicts price will go down  
- **HOLD**: AI suggests keeping current position

**Signal Strength (0.0 to 1.0):**
- **0.0 - 0.3**: Weak signal (usually ignored)
- **0.3 - 0.6**: Medium signal (proceed with caution)
- **0.6 - 0.8**: Strong signal (high confidence)
- **0.8 - 1.0**: Very strong signal (rare, highest confidence)

**Confidence Score:**
- How sure the AI is about the prediction
- Higher confidence = more reliable signal
- Only trade signals with confidence > 0.6

### **Risk Metrics Explained**

**Portfolio Exposure:**
- Percentage of your money currently invested
- 50% = Half your money is in stocks
- 100% = All your money is in stocks

**Risk Level:**
- **LOW**: Conservative, safer positions
- **MEDIUM**: Balanced risk/reward
- **HIGH**: Aggressive, higher risk

**Volatility:**
- How much the stock price fluctuates
- Higher volatility = more risk but potential for higher returns

### **Performance Metrics**

**Sharpe Ratio:**
- Measures risk-adjusted returns
- Higher is better (above 1.0 is good)
- Above 2.0 is excellent

**Win Rate:**
- Percentage of profitable trades
- 60%+ is considered good
- 70%+ is excellent

**Maximum Drawdown:**
- Largest loss from peak to trough
- Lower is better
- Keep under 10% for safety

## üìù **Paper Trading Setup**

### **What is Paper Trading?**
Paper trading lets you test the system with **fake money** using **real market data**. It's the safest way to learn and test strategies.

### **Step 1: Start Paper Trading**
```bash
# Start paper trading with $100,000 fake money
python src/main.py --paper --initial-capital 100000
```

### **Step 2: Monitor Your Paper Trades**
```bash
# Start the web dashboard
python src/monitoring/dashboard.py
```

Then open your browser to: `http://localhost:8050`

### **Step 3: Review Performance**
```bash
# Generate performance report
python src/analysis/generate_report.py --paper
```

### **Paper Trading Best Practices**
1. **Start with small amounts** (even in paper trading)
2. **Run for at least 1 month** before considering live trading
3. **Monitor daily** to understand the system behavior
4. **Keep a trading journal** of what you learn
5. **Test different settings** to find what works best

---

## üí∞ **Live Trading Setup**

2. Go to "Account" > "Transfers"
3. Link your bank account
4. Transfer money (start with a small amount)
5. Wait for funds to settle (usually 1-3 business days)

### **Step 2: Switch to Live Trading**
```bash
# Edit your .env file
ALPACA_API_KEY=your_live_api_key_here
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_live_secret_key_here
ALPACA_BASE_URL=https://api.alpaca.markets
```

### **Step 3: Start Live Trading**
```bash
# Start with a small amount
python src/main.py --live --initial-capital 1000
```

### **Step 4: Monitor Closely**
